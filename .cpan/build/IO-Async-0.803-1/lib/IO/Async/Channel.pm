=head1 NAME

C<IO::Async::Channel> - pass values into or out from an L<IO::Async::Routine>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<IO::Async::Channel> object allows Perl values to be passed into or out of
an L<IO::Async::Routine>. It is intended to be used primarily with a Routine
object rather than independently. For more detail and examples on how to use
this object see also the documentation for L<IO::Async::Routine>.

A Channel object is shared between the main process of the program and the
process running within the Routine. In the main process it will be used in
asynchronous mode, and in the Routine process it will be used in synchronous
mode. In asynchronous mode all methods return immediately and use
L<IO::Async>-style futures or callback functions. In synchronous within the
Routine process the methods block until they are ready and may be used for
flow-control within the routine. Alternatively, a Channel may be shared
between two different Routine objects, and not used directly by the
controlling program.

The channel itself represents a FIFO of Perl reference values. New values may
be put into the channel by the C<send> method in either mode. Values may be
retrieved from it by the C<recv> method. Values inserted into the Channel are
snapshot by the C<send> method. Any changes to referred variables will not be
observed by the other end of the Channel after the C<send> method returns.

=head1 PARAMETERS

The following named parameters may be passed to C<new> or C<configure>:

=head2 codec => STR

Gives the name of the encoding method used to represent values over the
channel.

This can be set to C<Storable> to use the core L<Storable> module. As this
only supports references, to pass a single scalar value, C<send> a SCALAR
reference to it, and dereference the result of C<recv>.

If the L<Sereal::Encoder> and L<Sereal::Decoder> modules are installed, this
can be set to C<Sereal> instead, and will use those to perform the encoding
and decoding. This optional dependency may give higher performance than using
C<Storable>. If these modules are available, then this option is picked by
default.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=cut

=head2 new

   $channel = IO::Async::Channel->new;

Returns a new C<IO::Async::Channel> object. This object reference itself
should be shared by both sides of a C<fork()>ed process. After C<fork()> the
two C<setup_*> methods may be used to configure the object for operation on
either end.

While this object does in fact inherit from L<IO::Async::Notifier>, it should
not be added to a Loop object directly; event management will be handled by
its containing L<IO::Async::Routine> object.

=head1 METHODS

The following methods documented in C<await> expressions return L<Future>
instances.

=cut

=head2 configure

   $channel->configure( %params );

Similar to the standard C<configure> method on L<IO::Async::Notifier>, this is
used to change details of the Channel's operation.

=over 4

=item on_recv => CODE

May only be set on an async mode channel. If present, will be invoked whenever
a new value is received, rather than using the C<recv> method.

   $on_recv->( $channel, $data );

=item on_eof => CODE

May only be set on an async mode channel. If present, will be invoked when the
channel gets closed by the peer.

   $on_eof->( $channel );

      sub { ( $decoder ||= Sereal::Decoder->new )->decode( $_[0] ) };
}

=head2 send

   $channel->send( $data );

Pushes the data stored in the given Perl reference into the FIFO of the
Channel, where it can be received by the other end. When called on a
synchronous mode Channel this method may block if a C<write()> call on the
underlying filehandle blocks. When called on an asynchronous mode channel this
method will not block.

   my ( $self, $data ) = @_;
   $self->send_encoded( $self->{encode}->( $data ) );
};

=head2 send_encoded

   $channel->send_encoded( $record );

A variant of the C<send> method; this method pushes the byte record given.
This should be the result of a call to C<encode>.

=cut

sub send_encoded
{
   my $self = shift;
   my ( $record ) = @_;

   my $bytes = pack( "I", length $record ) . $record;

   defined $self->{mode} or die "Cannot ->send without being set up";

   return $self->_sendbytes_sync( $bytes )  if $self->{mode} eq "sync";
   return $self->_sendbytes_async( $bytes ) if $self->{mode} eq "async";
}

=head2 encode

   $record = $channel->encode( $data );

Takes a Perl reference and returns a serialised string that can be passed to
C<send_encoded>. The following two forms are equivalent

   $channel->send( $data );
   $channel->send_encoded( $channel->encode( $data ) );

This is provided for the use-case where data needs to be serialised into a
fixed string to "snapshot it" but not sent yet; the returned string can be
saved and sent at a later time.

   $record = IO::Async::Channel->encode( $data );

This can also be used as a class method, in case it is inconvenient to operate
on a particular object instance, or when one does not exist yet. In this case
it will encode using whatever is the default codec for C<IO::Async::Channel>.

=cut

my $default_encode;

   )->( $data );
}

=head2 recv

   $data = $channel->recv;

When called on a synchronous mode Channel this method will block until a Perl
reference value is available from the other end and then return it. If the
Channel is closed this method will return C<undef>. Since only references may
be passed and all Perl references are true the truth of the result of this
method can be used to detect that the channel is still open and has not yet
been closed.

   $data = await $channel->recv;

When called on an asynchronous mode Channel this method returns a future which
will eventually yield the next Perl reference value that becomes available
from the other end. If the Channel is closed, the future will fail with an
C<eof> failure.

   $channel->recv( %args );

When not returning a future, takes the following named arguments:

=over 8

=item on_recv => CODE

Called when a new Perl reference value is available. Will be passed the
Channel object and the reference data.

   $on_recv->( $channel, $data );

=item on_eof => CODE

Called if the Channel was closed before a new value was ready. Will be passed
the Channel object.

   $on_eof->( $channel );

=head2 close
