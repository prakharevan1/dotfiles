=head1 NAME

C<Future::IO::Impl::IOAsync> - implement C<Future::IO> using C<IO::Async>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an implementation for L<Future::IO> which uses
L<IO::Async>.

There are no additional methods to use in this module; it simply has to be
loaded, and will provide the C<Future::IO> implementation methods.

   use Future::IO::Impl::IOAsync;

   my $f = Future::IO->sleep(5);
